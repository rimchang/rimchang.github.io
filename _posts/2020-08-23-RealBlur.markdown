We proposed the [RealBlur](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/research/RealBlur/#download){:target="_blank"} dataset, which is the first real-world blur dataset for learning-based methods. This dataset is now utilized as a standard [benchmark](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/deblurring-on-realblur-j-1){:target="_blank"}.
